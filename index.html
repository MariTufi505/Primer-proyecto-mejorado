            <article><h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Divine Comedy is an epic poem by <b>Dante Alighieri</b>, written in the early 14th century. It follows Dante’s journey through three realms of the afterlife: <a href=""><b>Inferno (Hell)</b></a>, <a href=""><b>Purgatorio (Purgatory)</b></a> , and <a href=""><b>Paradiso (Paradise)</b></a>. Guided first by the Roman poet <a href=""><b>Virgil</b></a> and later by his beloved <a href=""><b>Beatrice</b></a>, Dante witnesses the consequences of sin, the process of purification, and the bliss of divine presence. The work is both a spiritual allegory of the soul’s journey toward God and a reflection on morality, justice, and redemption.</p>

            <p> <b>Dante Alighieri</b> (1265–1321) was an Italian poet, writer, and philosopher from Florence, best known for <i>The Divine Comedy</i>. He was deeply involved in Florentine politics, which eventually led to his exile from the city in 1302. During his exile, he wrote much of his most famous work, blending classical knowledge, Christian theology, and personal experiences. Dante died in Ravenna in 1321, leaving a lasting impact on literature and the Italian language. </p>

            <article><h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
            <p> <i>The Divine Comedy</i> has had a profound and lasting influence on Western culture. It helped shape the Italian language, setting a literary standard much like <i>Shakespeare</i> did for English. The poem’s vivid imagery of <i>Hell, Purgatory,</i> and <i>Paradise</i> influenced countless artists, writers, and thinkers, inspiring works in painting, sculpture, music, and literature. Its moral and philosophical themes have been studied for centuries, contributing to debates on justice, morality, and the human soul’s journey. The work also bridged medieval and Renaissance thought, blending classical ideas with Christian theology, making it a cornerstone of world literature. </p>
